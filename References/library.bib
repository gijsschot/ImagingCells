abstract = {In a flash diffraction experiment, a short and extremely intense x-ray pulse illuminates the sample to obtain a diffraction pattern before the onset of significant radiation damage. The over-sampled diffraction pattern permits phase retrieval by iterative phasing methods. Flash diffractive imaging was first demonstrated on an inorganic test object (Chapman et al 2006 Nat. Phys. 2 839–43). We report here experiments on biological systems where individual cells were imaged, using single, 10–15 fs soft x-ray pulses at 13.5 nm wavelength from the FLASH free-electron laser in Hamburg. Simulations show that the pulse heated the sample to about 160 000 K but not before an interpretable diffraction pattern could be obtained. The reconstructed projection images return the structures of the intact cells. The simulations suggest that the average displacement of ions and atoms in the hottest surface layers remained below 3 {\AA}during the pulse.},

abstract = {The past few years have seen a tremendous growth in the field of coherent X-ray diffractive imaging, in large part due to X-ray free-electron lasers which provide a peak brilliance billions of times higher than that of synchrotrons. However, this rapid development in terms of hardware has not been matched on the software side. The release of Hawk is intended to close this gap. To the authors' knowledge Hawk is the first publicly available and fully open source software program for reconstructing images from continuous diffraction patterns. The software handles all steps leading from a raw diffraction pattern to a reconstructed two-dimensional image including geometry determination, background correction, masking and phasing. It also includes preliminary three-dimensional support and support for graphics processing units using the Compute Unified Device Architecture, which speeds up processing by orders of magnitude compared to a single central processing unit. Hawk implements numerous algorithms and is easily extended. This, in combination with its open-source licence, provides a platform for other groups to test, develop and distribute their own algorithms. Hawk is available under the GNU General Public License from http://xray.bmc.uu.se/hawk.},

abstract = {In-house developed cameras and other commercial detectors are typically tested with x-ray tubes and at synchrotron beamlines before being deployed and used for science experiments. In a prototyping phase, this is needed to understand and characterize the behavior of the detector. In a more advanced development phase, measurements with x-rays are required to characterize and calibrate the camera. Tests at synchrotron beamlines in actual experimental conditions are indeed a valuable source for detector developers. However, when all photons arrive at once, as for FELs, the response of the detector can be very different from that obtained with a synchrotron beam which behaves more like a CW (continuous) source. This behavior was already observed during users runs at LCLS and recently investigated during dedicated detector beamtime. The linearity of the response of the Cornell-SLAC Pixel Array Detector (CSPAD) was investigated. Results are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Emerging X-ray free-electron lasers with femtosecond pulse duration enable single-shot snapshot imaging almost free from sample damage by outrunning major radiation damage processes. In bioimaging, it is essential to keep the sample close to its natural state. Conventional high-resolution imaging, however, suffers from severe radiation damage that hinders live cell imaging. Here we present a method for capturing snapshots of live cells kept in a micro-liquid enclosure array by X-ray laser diffraction. We place living Microbacterium lacticum cells in an enclosure array and successively expose each enclosure to a single X-ray laser pulse from the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Free-Electron Laser. The enclosure itself works as a guard slit and allows us to record a coherent diffraction pattern from a weakly-scattering submicrometre-sized cell with a clear fringe extending up to a 28-nm full-period resolution. The reconstructed image reveals living whole-cell structures without any staining, which helps advance understanding of intracellular phenomena.},

@article{chapman_2011-Mg,
abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded. It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals (∼200 nm to 2 $\mu$m in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage.},

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have opened up the possibility of structure determination of protein crystals at room temperature, free of radiation damage. The femtosecond-duration pulses of these sources enable diffraction signals to be collected from samples at doses of 1000 MGy or higher. The sample is vaporized by the intense pulse, but not before the scattering that gives rise to the diffraction pattern takes place. Consequently, only a single flash diffraction pattern can be recorded from a crystal, giving rise to the method of serial crystallography where tens of thousands of patterns are collected from individual crystals that flow across the beam and the patterns are indexed and aggregated into a set of structure factors. The high-dose tolerance and the many-crystal averaging approach allow data to be collected from much smaller crystals than have been examined at synchrotron radiation facilities, even from radiation-sensitive samples. Here, we review the interaction of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses with materials and discuss the implications for structure determination. We identify various dose regimes and conclude that the strongest achievable signals for a given sample are attained at the highest possible dose rates, from highest possible pulse intensities.},

abstract = {Sample damage by X-rays and other radiation limits the resolution of structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible structures such as individual biomolecules or cells. Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements. Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per A2 with X-rays of 12 keV energy or 1 A wavelength) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

We have developed software that automates this process and results in consistently accurate diffraction patterns. We have furthermore derived some criteria of validity for a tool commonly used to assess the consistency of reconstructions, the phase retrieval transfer function, and suggest a modified version that has improved utility for judging reconstruction quality.},

It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input-output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},

abstract = {{\#} Single-particle diffraction from X-ray Free Electron Lasers offers the potential for molecular structure determination without the need for crystallization. In an effort to further develop the technique, we present a dataset of coherent soft X-ray diffraction images of Coliphage PR772 virus, collected at the Atomic Molecular Optics (AMO) beamline with pnCCD detectors in the LAMP instrument at the Linac Coherent Light Source. The diameter of PR772 ranges from 65–70 nm, which is considerably smaller than the previously reported {\~{}}600 nm diameter Mimivirus. This reflects continued progress in XFEL-based single-particle imaging towards the single molecular imaging regime. The data set contains significantly more single particle hits than collected in previous experiments, enabling the development of improved statistical analysis, reconstruction algorithms, and quantitative metrics to determine resolution and self-consistency.},

abstract = {X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biological systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions. Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma. The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval. Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies.},

Powerful algorithms are increasingly being used to act as lenses to form such images. Current image reconstruction methods, however, require the knowledge of the shape of the object and the low spatial frequencies unavoidably lost in experiments. Diffractive imaging has thus previously been used to increase the resolution of images obtained by other means.

abstract = {Omono River virus (OmRV) is a double-stranded RNA virus isolated from Culex mosquitos, and it belongs to a group of unassigned insect viruses that appear to be related to Totiviridae. This paper describes electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) structures for the intact OmRV virion to 8.9 {\AA}resolution and the structure of the empty virus-like-particle, that lacks RNA, to 8.3 {\AA}resolution. The icosahedral capsid contains 120-subunits and resembles another closely related arthropod-borne totivirus-like virus, the infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) from shrimps. Both viruses have an elevated plateau around their icosahedral 5-fold axes, surrounded by a deep canyon. Sequence and structural analysis suggests that this plateau region is mainly composed of the extended C-terminal region of the capsid proteins. In contrast to IMNV, the infectious form of OmRV lacks extensive fibre complexes at its 5-fold axes as directly confirmed by a contrast-enhancement technique, using Zernike phase-contrast cryo-EM. Instead, these fibre complexes are replaced by a short "plug" structure at the five-fold axes of OmRV. OmRV and IMNV have acquired an extracellular phase, and the structures at the five-fold axes may be significant in adaptation to cell-to-cell transmission in metazoan hosts.},

The geometric construction of the difference map illuminates the distinction between its fixed points and the recovered object, as well as the mechanism whereby the form of stagnation encountered by alternating projection schemes is avoided. When support constraints are replaced by object histogram or atomicity constraints, the difference map lends itself to crystallographic phase retrieval.

The detector has a full well capacity of about 2.Sk photons in low-gain mode and a SIN of about 6 in high-gain mode. Its 2.3M pixels are read out at 120 Hz. The detector comprises 32 500?m silicon sensors bump-bonded to 64 185�194-pixel ASICs. The pixel size is 110?m. The water-cooled detector quadrants can be radially moved in-situ to vary the beam aperture. SLAC has built, calibrated, and optimized three complete camera systems based on a sensor and ASIC designed by Cornell. The camera is read out by a DAQ system which provides extensive online monitoring and prompt analysis capabilities. We have also built a dozen smaller cameras in a portable form-factor for use in confined spaces and for ease of development, testing, and deployment. Through 2012 user experiments have taken almost a petabyte of data with these detectors in a variety of applications. We have extensively tested the detector at synchrotrons and with an x-ray tube, in addition to commissioning tests at the LCLS, investigating linearity, cross-talk, homogeneity, and radiation hardness. The SLAC detector group is deploying improved support infrastructure and an updated ASIC and electronics based on this experience. This paper describes the instrument, its calibration and performance, and presents preliminary results from the updated camera.},

Ptychographic phasing algorithms use information from coherent diffraction to deliver quantitative images of the specimen at a resolution higher than the scanning resolution. These algorithms have traditionally been implemented in software on a per-instrument basis in various degrees of user-friendliness and sophistication. Here, we present Ptypy, a ptychography software written with the intention to serve as a framework across the diverse sets of available instruments and usage cases. A distinctive feature of the software is its formalism, which provides a convenient abstraction of the physical model, thus allowing for concise algorithmic implementations and portability across set-up geometries. We give an overview of the supported usage cases, explain the abstraction layer and design principles, and provide a step-by-step guide describing how an algorithm may be realized in a concise and readable manner.

The technique has been demonstrated successfully at optical and X-ray wavelengths and has been shown to be robust to detector noise and to converge considerably faster than support-based phase retrieval methods. In this paper, the PIE is extended so that the requirement for an accurate model of the illumination function is removed. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we demonstrate that combination of a new and improved fragment picker and the iterative sampling algorithm RASREC yield significant improvements in convergence and accuracy. Moreover, we introduce improved criteria for assessing the accuracy of the models produced by the method. The method was tested on 39 proteins in the 50-100 residue size range and yields reliable structures in 70 {\%} of the cases.

We show here that ptychography—a form of {\{}CDI{\}} that uses many diffraction patterns—is not subject to this constraint.

@article{Thibault2013,
abstract = {Progress in imaging and metrology depends on exquisite control over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses. Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states. Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments. Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography, the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.},

abstract = {Detailed structural investigations on living cells are problematic because existing structural methods cannot reach high resolutions on non-reproducible objects. Illumination with an ultrashort and extremely bright X-ray pulse can outrun key damage processes over a very short period. This can be exploited to extend the diffraction signal to the highest possible resolution in flash diffraction experiments. Here we present an analysis of the interaction of a very intense and very short X-ray pulse with a living cell, using a non-equilibrium population kinetics plasma code with radiation transfer. Each element in the evolving plasma is modeled by numerous states to monitor changes in the atomic populations as a function of pulse length, wavelength, and fluence. The model treats photoionization, impact ionization, Auger decay, recombination, and inverse bremsstrahlung by solving rate equations in a self-consistent manner and describes hydrodynamic expansion through the ion sound speed. The results show that subnanometer resolutions could be reached on micron-sized cells in a diffraction-limited geometry at wavelengths between 0.75 and 1.5 nm and at fluences of 1011-1012 photons microm-2 in less than 10 fs. Subnanometer resolutions could also be achieved with harder X-rays at higher fluences. We discuss experimental and computational strategies to obtain depth information about the object in flash diffraction experiments.},

However, a fast development of instruments and software for cryo-EM in the last decade has allowed that a large range of complexes can be studied by cryo-EM, and that their structures can be obtained at near-atomic resolution, including the structures of small complexes (e.g., membrane proteins) whose size was earlier an obstacle to cryo-EM. Image analysis to identify multiple coexisting structures in the same specimen (multiconformation reconstruction) is now routinely done both to solve structures at near-atomic resolution and to study conformational dynamics.

abstract = {The science of wave-field phase retrieval and phase measurement is sufficiently mature to permit the routine reconstruction, over a given plane, of the complex wave-function associated with certain coherent forward-propagating scalar wave-fields. This reconstruction gives total knowledge of the information that has been encoded in the complex wave-field by passage through a sample of interest. Such total knowledge is powerful, because it permits the emulation in software of the subsequent action of an infinite variety of coherent imaging systems. Such 'virtual optics', in which software forms a natural extension of the 'hardware optics' in an imaging system, may be useful in contexts such as quantitative atom and X-ray imaging, in which optical elements such as beam-splitters and lenses can be realized in software rather than optical hardware. Here, we develop the requisite theory to describe such hybrid virtual-physical imaging systems, which we term 'omni optics' because of their infinite flexibility. We then give an experimental demonstration of these ideas by showing that a lensless X-ray point projection microscope can, when equipped with the appropriate software, emulate an infinite variety of optical imaging systems including those which yield interferograms, Zernike phase contrast, Schlieren imaging and diffraction-enhanced imaging.},

abstract = {X-ray lasers may allow structural studies on single particles and biomolecules without crystalline periodicity in the samples. We examine here the effect of sample dynamics as a source of structural heterogeneity on the resolution of the reconstructed image of a small protein molecule. Structures from molecular-dynamics simulations of lysozyme were sampled and aligned. These structures were then used to calculate diffraction patterns corresponding to different dynamic states. The patterns were incoherently summed and the resulting data set was phased using the oversampling method. Reconstructed images of hydrated and dehydrated lysozyme gave resolutions of 3.7 A and 7.6 A , respectively. These are significantly worse than the root-mean-square deviation of the hydrated ( 2.7 A for all atoms and 1.45 A for C-alpha positions) or dehydrated ( 3.7 A for all atoms and 2.5 A for C-alpha positions) structures. The noise introduced by structural dynamics and incoherent addition of dissimilar structures restricts the maximum resolution to be expected from direct image reconstruction of dynamic systems. A way of potentially reducing this effect is by grouping dynamic structures into distinct structural substates and solving them separately.},

@article{ayyer_2016-Re,
abstract = {The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules and their complexes are mainly elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major limitation of this method is access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks suggests that crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice give rise to a continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more information than Bragg peaks alone. Although such continuous diffraction patterns have long been observed--and are of interest as a source of information about the dynamics of proteins--they have not been used for structure determination. Here we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the diffraction pattern well beyond the 4.5-$\backslash$aangstr{\"{o}}m limit of measurable Bragg peaks, which allows us to phase the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope conventionally determined at 4.5 $\backslash$aangstr{\"{o}}ms as a constraint, we obtain a static image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3.5 $\backslash$aangstr{\"{o}}ms. This result shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables model-free phasing.},

@book{Paganin2006,
abstract = {This book offers a grounding in the field of coherent X-ray optics, which in the closing years of the 20th century experienced something of a renaissance with the availability of third-generation synchrotron sources. It begins with a treatment of the fundamentals of X-ray diffraction for both coherent and partially coherent radiation, together with the interactions of X-rays with matter. X-ray sources, optical elements, and detectors are then discussed, with an emphasis on their role in coherent X-ray optics. Various aspects of coherent X-ray imaging are then considered, including holography, interferometry, self imaging, phase contrast, and phase retrieval. The foundations of the new field of singular X-ray optics are examined, focusing on the topic of X-ray phase vortices. Most topics in the book are developed from first principles using a chain of logic which ultimately derives from the Maxwell equations, with numerous references to the contemporary and historical research literature.},

abstract = {Iterative algorithms for phase retrieval from intensity data are compared to gradient search methods. Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input-output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},

@article{Loh2009,
abstract = {We introduce the EMC algorithm for reconstructing a particle's three-dimensional (3D) diffraction intensity from very many photon shot-noise limited two-dimensional measurements, when the particle orientation in each measurement is unknown. The algorithm combines a maximization step (M) of the intensity's likelihood function, with expansion (E) and compression (C) steps that map the 3D intensity model to a redundant tomographic representation and back again. After a few iterations of the EMC update rule, the reconstructed intensity is given to the difference-map algorithm for reconstruction of the particle contrast. We demonstrate reconstructions with simulated data and investigate the effects of particle complexity, number of measurements, and the number of photons per measurement. The relatively transparent scaling behavior of our algorithm provides an estimate of the data processing resources required for future single-particle imaging experiments.},

With X-ray pulse durations down to 10 fs or shorter, and up to 10(13) transversely coherent photons per pulse in a narrow spectral bandwidth, focused irradiances of 10(18) to 10(21) W cm(-2) or higher can be produced at X-ray energies ranging from 500 eV to 10 keV. New techniques for determining the structure of systems that cannot be crystallized and for studying the time-resolved behavior of irreversible reactions at femtosecond timescales are now available.},

abstract = {Iterative projection algorithms are successfully being used as a substitute of lenses to recombine, numerically rather than optically, light scattered by illuminated objects. Images obtained computationally allow aberration-free diffraction-limited imaging and the possibility of using radiation for which no lenses exist. The challenge of this imaging technique is transfered from the lenses to the algorithms. We evaluate these new computational ``instruments'' developed for the phase retrieval problem, and discuss acceleration strategies.},
