abstract = {A capillary steady microjet produced at the discharge region of a gas jet expanding into vacuum is imaged using scanning electron microscopy. The co-flowing gas focuses by inertia and pulls the liquid fed through a capillary tube concentrically positioned at the discharge orifice. The jet breaks up into well-collimated droplets. Numerical simulation explains the persistence of the liquid phase after discharge into vacuum.},
