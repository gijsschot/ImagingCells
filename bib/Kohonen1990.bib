abstract = {The self-organized map, an architecture suggested for artificial
neural networks, is explained by presenting simulation experiments and
practical applications. The self-organizing map has the property of
effectively creating spatially organized internal representations of
various features of input signals and their abstractions. One result of
this is that the self-organization process can discover semantic
relationships in sentences. Brain maps, semantic maps, and early work on
competitive learning are reviewed. The self-organizing map algorithm (an
algorithm which order responses spatially) is reviewed, focusing on best
matching cell selection and adaptation of the weight vectors.
Suggestions for applying the self-organizing map algorithm,
demonstrations of the ordering process, and an example of hierarchical
clustering of data are presented. Fine tuning the map by learning vector
quantization is addressed. The use of self-organized maps in practical
speech recognition and a simulation experiment on semantic mapping are
discussed},
