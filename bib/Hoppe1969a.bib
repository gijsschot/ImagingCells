abstract = {The principles established for periodic objects in parts I and II$\backslash$backslash{\{}$\backslash${\$}{\}}nare extended to non-periodic objects. The basis for the extension\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}nlies in the possibility of introducing a virtual lattice, which can$\backslash$backslash{\{}$\backslash${\$}{\}}nbe treated as in parts I and II when working with a primary wave\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}nfield that has zero amplitude outside a given spatial region. Thus$\backslash$backslash{\{}$\backslash${\$}{\}}nit becomes possible to form an image without the use of a lens in\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}na manner similar to holography but based on different principles.$\backslash$backslash{\{}$\backslash${\$}{\}}nA reference wave (as used in holography) is not required. The new\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}nprinciple can be applied in a number of variations, some of which{\$}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}nare discussed.},
