abstract = {The concepts of dilation symmetry and the fractal dimension are introduced, and from these basic concepts scattering functions are computed for surface and mass fractals. It is then shown how the fractal structure of various random media has been elucidated from scattering measurements, and how these observations relate to specific models of fractal geometry. Examples include colloidal aggregates, gels, soot and the fractal porosity of rocks of various sorts.},
