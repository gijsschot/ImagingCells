abstract = {We propose a method for determining the projected electron density of an individual molecule from diffraction patterns of many such simultaneously illuminated molecules, randomly oriented about an axis parallel to an incident x-ray beam. We illustrate the idea with a simulation of a structure determination of a K-channel membrane protein in situ.},
