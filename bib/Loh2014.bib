abstract = {The ability to serially interrogate single biomolecules with femtosecond X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers has ushered in the possibility of determining the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules without crystallization. However, the complexity of imaging a sample's structure from very many of its noisy and incomplete diffraction data can be daunting. In this review, we introduce a simple analogue of this imaging workflow, use it to describe a structure reconstruction algorithm based on the expectation maximization principle, and consider the effects of extraneous noise. Such a minimal model can aid experiment and algorithm design in future studies.},
