abstract = {The form of a two-dimensional image is shown to be uniquely related to the intensity of its Fourier transform. No distinction is made between the form of the image and (the complex conjugate of) its mirror image. The uniqueness is unequivocal for a real, positive image. If the image is complex, or real but not necessarily positive, uniqueness only applies for the most compact image compatible with the given samples of the Fourier intensity. The number and spacing of the samples must be adequate to permit the autocorrelation of the image to be accurately reconstructed. Unlike other demonstrations of this uniqueness, the approach intro- duced here leads directly to a computationally realizable phase-restoration algorithm, which is a distinct theoretical and practical improvement on earlier (somewhat ad hoc) algorithms of the same general type.},
