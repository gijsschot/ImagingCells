abstract = {Mimivirus is the largest known virus. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the virus was shown to be icosahedral, covered by long fibers, and appears to have at least two lipid membranes within its protein capsid. A unique vertex, presumably for attachment and infection of the host, can be seen for particles that have a suitable orientation on the micrographs.},
