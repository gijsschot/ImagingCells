abstract = {A method is developed for representing any communica-tion system geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two " function spaces, I' and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication theory are deduced concerning expansion and compres-sion of bandwidth and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maximum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of " ideal " system which transmii at this maximum rate are disncrsed The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated},
