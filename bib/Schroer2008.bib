abstract = {Coherent x-ray diffraction imaging is an x-ray microscopy technique with the potential of reaching spatial resolutions well beyond the diffraction limits of x-ray microscopes based on optics. However, the available coherent dose at modern x-ray sources is limited, setting practical bounds on the spatial resolution of the technique. By focusing the available coherent flux onto the sample, the spatial resolution can be improved for radiation-hard specimens. A small gold particle (size {\textless}100 nm{\textless}math display="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}{\textless}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}100{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;{\textless}mi{\textgreater}nm) was illuminated with a hard x-ray nanobeam (E=15.25 keV{\textless}math display="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}E{\textless}mo{\textgreater}={\textless}mn{\textgreater}15.25{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;{\textless}mi{\textgreater}keV, beam dimensions ≈100×100 nm2{\textless}math display="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}{\&}asymp;{\textless}mn{\textgreater}100{\textless}mo{\textgreater}{\&}times;{\textless}mn{\textgreater}100{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}nm{\textless}mn{\textgreater}2) and is reconstructed from its coherent diffraction pattern. A resolution of about 5 nm is achieved in 600 s exposure time.},
