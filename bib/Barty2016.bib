abstract = {The potential to image single molecules in action without the need for crystallisation was one of the most exciting applications promised during construction of the first XFELs. Over the past years significant progress has been made, even though the goal of molecular imaging has not yet been achieved. This article reviews the current status, and the steps required to realise X-ray single particle imaging.},
