Imaging live cells at nanometre resolution is challenging because radiation damage kills the cells during exposure. Here, the authors overcome this difficulty in a ‘diffraction before destruction' experiment using an X-ray laser and record signal to 4 nm resolution on a{\&}hellip;{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
