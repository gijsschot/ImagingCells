abstract = {We have used the method of x-ray diffraction microscopy to image the complex-valued exit wave of an intact and unstained yeast cell. The images of the freeze-dried cell, obtained by using 750-eV x-rays from different angular orientations, portray several of the cell's major internal components to 30-nm resolution. The good agreement among the independently recovered structures demonstrates the accuracy of the imaging technique. To obtain the best possible reconstructions, we have implemented procedures for handling noisy and incomplete diffraction data, and we propose a method for determining the reconstructed resolution. This work represents a previously uncharacterized application of x-ray diffraction microscopy to a specimen of this complexity and provides confidence in the feasibility of the ultimate goal of imaging biological specimens at 10-nm resolution in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Conventional three-dimensional (3D) structure determination methods require either multiple measurements at different sample orientations or a collection of serial sections through a sample. Here we report the experimental demonstration of single-shot 3D structure determination of an object; in this case, individual gold nanocrystals at {\~{}}5.5 nm resolution using {\~{}}10 fs X-ray free-electron laser pulses. Coherent diffraction patterns are collected from high-index-faceted nanocrystals, each struck by an X-ray free-electron laser pulse. Taking advantage of the symmetry of the nanocrystal and the curvature of the Ewald sphere, we reconstruct the 3D structure of each nanocrystal from a single-shot diffraction pattern. By averaging a sufficient number of identical nanocrystals, this method may be used to determine the 3D structure of nanocrystals at atomic resolution. As symmetry exists in many virus particles, this method may also be applied to 3D structure studies of such particles at nanometer resolution on femtosecond time scales.},

@article{VanHeel2005,
abstract = {The resolution value claimed for an electron microscopical three-dimensional reconstruction indicates the overall quality of the experiment. The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion has now become the standard quality measure. However, what has continued to be controversial is the issue of the FSC threshold level at which one defines the reproducible resolution. Here, we discuss the theoretical behaviour of the FSC in conjunction with the various factors which influence it: the number of "voxels" in a given Fourier shell, the symmetry of the structure, and the size of the structure within the reconstruction volume. Both the theoretical considerations and our model experiments show that fixed-valued FSC threshold (like "0.5") may never be used in a reproducible criterion. Fixed threshold values are-as we show here-simply the result of incorrect assumptions in the basic statistics. Two families of FSC threshold curves are discussed: the sigma-factor curves and the new family of bit-based information threshold curves. Whereas sigma-factor curves indicate the resolution level at which one has collected information significantly above the noise level, the information curves indicate the resolution level at which enough information has been collected for interpretation.},

@article{Walczak2014,
abstract = {We developed a Bayesian method to extract macromolecular structure information from sparse single-molecule x-ray free-electron laser diffraction images. The method addresses two possible scenarios. First, using a “seed” structural model, the molecular orientation is determined for each of the provided diffraction images, which are then averaged in three-dimensional reciprocal space. Subsequently, the real space electron density is determined using a relaxed averaged alternating reflections algorithm. In the second approach, the probability that the “seed” model fits to the given set of diffraction images as a whole is determined and used to distinguish between proposed structures. We show that for a given x-ray intensity, unexpectedly, the achievable resolution increases with molecular mass such that structure determination should be more challenging for small molecules than for larger ones. For a sufficiently large number of recorded photons ({\textgreater}200) per diffraction image an M1/6 scaling is seen. Using synthetic diffraction data for a small glutathione molecule as a challenging test case, successful determination of electron density was demonstrated for 20000 diffraction patterns with random orientations and an average of 82 elastically scattered and recorded photons per image, also in the presence of up to 50{\%} background noise. The second scenario is exemplified and assessed for three biomolecules of different sizes. In all cases, determining the probability of a structure given set of diffraction patterns allowed successful discrimination between different conformations of the test molecules. A structure model of the glutathione tripeptide was refined in a Monte Carlo simulation from a random starting conformation. Further, effective distinguishing between three differently arranged immunoglobulin domains of a titin molecule and also different states of a ribosome in a tRNA translocation process was demonstrated. These results show that the proposed method is robust and enables structure determination from sparse and noisy x-ray diffraction images of single molecules spanning a wide range of molecular masses.},

However, a fast development of instruments and software for cryo-EM in the last decade has allowed that a large range of complexes can be studied by cryo-EM, and that their structures can be obtained at near-atomic resolution, including the structures of small complexes (e.g., membrane proteins) whose size was earlier an obstacle to cryo-EM. Image analysis to identify multiple coexisting structures in the same specimen (multiconformation reconstruction) is now routinely done both to solve structures at near-atomic resolution and to study conformational dynamics. Methods for multiconformation reconstruction and latest examples of their applications are the focus of this review.},

abstract = {This study explores the capabilities of the Coherent X-ray Imaging Instrument at the Linac Coherent Light Source to image small biological samples. The weak signal from small samples puts a significant demand on the experiment. Aerosolized Omono River virus particles of ∼40 nm in diameter were injected into the submicrometre X-ray focus at a reduced pressure. Diffraction patterns were recorded on two area detectors. The statistical nature of the measurements from many individual particles provided information about the intensity profile of the X-ray beam, phase variations in the wavefront and the size distribution of the injected particles. The results point to a wider than expected size distribution (from ∼35 to ∼300 nm in diameter). This is likely to be owing to nonvolatile contaminants from larger droplets during aerosolization and droplet evaporation. The results suggest that the concentration of nonvolatile contaminants and the ratio between the volumes of the initial droplet and the sample particles is critical in such studies. The maximum beam intensity in the focus was found to be 1.9 × 10 12 photons per µm 2 per pulse. The full-width of the focus at half-maximum was estimated to be 500 nm (assuming 20{\%} beamline transmission), and this width is larger than expected. Under these conditions, the diffraction signal from a sample-sized particle remained above the average background to a resolution of 4.25 nm. The results suggest that reducing the size of the initial droplets during aerosolization is necessary to bring small particles into the scope of detailed structural studies with X-ray lasers.},

(2000). Nature (London), 406, 752-757]. Even for a flat Ewald sphere, it is shown how the ambiguities due to Friedel's law may be overcome. The method breaks down for photon counts below about 10 per detector pixel, almost three orders of magnitude higher than expected for scattering by a 500 kDa protein with an XFEL beam focused to a 0.1 microm diameter spot. Even if 10(3) orientationally similar diffraction patterns could be identified and added to reach the requisite photon count per pixel, the need for about 10(6) orientational classes for high-resolution structure determination suggests that about 10(9) diffraction patterns must be recorded. Assuming pulse and readout rates of approximately 100 Hz, such measurements would require approximately 10(7) s, i.e. several months of continuous beam time.},

abstract = {The science of wave-field phase retrieval and phase measurement is sufficiently mature to permit the routine reconstruction, over a given plane, of the complex wave-function associated with certain coherent forward-propagating scalar wave-fields. This reconstruction gives total knowledge of the information that has been encoded in the complex wave-field by passage through a sample of interest. Such total knowledge is powerful, because it permits the emulation in software of the subsequent action of an infinite variety of coherent imaging systems. Such 'virtual optics', in which software forms a natural extension of the 'hardware optics' in an imaging system, may be useful in contexts such as quantitative atom and X-ray imaging, in which optical elements such as beam-splitters and lenses can be realized in software rather than optical hardware. Here, we develop the requisite theory to describe such hybrid virtual-physical imaging systems, which we term 'omni optics' because of their infinite flexibility. We then give an experimental demonstration of these ideas by showing that a lensless X-ray point projection microscope can, when equipped with the appropriate software, emulate an infinite variety of optical imaging systems including those which yield interferograms, Zernike phase contrast, Schlieren imaging and diffraction-enhanced imaging.},

In a single molecule imaging (SMI) experiment thousands of diffraction patterns of single molecules with random orientations are recorded. One of the most challenging problems of SMI is how to assemble these noisy patterns of unknown orientations into a consistent single set of diffraction data. Here we present a new method which can solve the orientation problem of SMI efficiently even for large biological molecules and in the presence of noise. We show on simulated diffraction patterns of a large protein molecule, how the orientations of the patterns can be found and the structure to atomic resolution can be solved. The concept of our algorithm could be also applied to experiments where images of an object are recorded in unknown orientations and/or positions like in cryoEM or tomography. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Ayyer2016,
abstract = {The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules and their complexes are mainly elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major limitation of this method is access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks suggests that crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice give rise to a continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more information than Bragg peaks alone. Although such continuous diffraction patterns have long been observed--and are of interest as a source of information about the dynamics of proteins--they have not been used for structure determination. Here we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the diffraction pattern well beyond the 4.5-{\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m limit of measurable Bragg peaks, which allows us to phase the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope conventionally determined at 4.5 {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}ms as a constraint, we obtain a static image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3.5 {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}ms. This result shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables model-free phasing.},

Its performance is demonstrated on simulated diffraction data sets and verification of the results indicates a high orientation accuracy even at low signal levels.

abstract = {The emerging technique of serial X-ray diffraction, in which diffraction data are collected from samples flowing across a pulsed X-ray source at repetition rates of 100 Hz or higher, has necessitated the development of new software in order to handle the large data volumes produced. Sorting of data according to different criteria and rapid filtering of events to retain only diffraction patterns of interest results in significant reductions in data volume, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis and management tasks. Meanwhile the generation of reduced data in the form of virtual powder patterns, radial stacks, histograms and other meta data creates data set summaries for analysis and overall experiment evaluation. Rapid data reduction early in the analysis pipeline is proving to be an essential first step in serial imaging experiments, prompting the authors to make the tool described in this article available to the general community. Originally developed for experiments at X-ray free-electron lasers, the software is based on a modular facility-independent library to promote portability between different experiments and is available under version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License.},

@article{Cruz-Mazo2017,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper, we analyse numerically the stability of the steady jetting regime of gaseous flow focusing. The base flows are calculated by solving the full Navier–Stokes equations and boundary conditions for a wide range of liquid viscosities and gas speeds. The axisymmetric modes characterizing the asymptotic stability of those flows are obtained from the linearized Navier–Stokes equations and boundary conditions. We determine the flow rates leading to marginally stable states, and compare them with the experimental values at the jetting-to-dripping transition. The theoretical predictions satisfactorily agree with the experimental results for large gas speeds. However, they do not capture the trend of the jetting-to-dripping transition curve for small gas velocities, and considerably underestimate the minimum flow rate in this case. To explain this discrepancy, the Navier–Stokes equations are integrated over time after introducing a small perturbation in the tapering liquid meniscus. There is a transient growth of the perturbation before the asymptotic exponential regime is reached, which leads to dripping. Our work shows that flow focusing stability can be explained in terms of the combination of asymptotic global stability and the system short-term response for large and small gas velocities, respectively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Sample damage by X-rays and other radiation limits the resolution of structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible structures such as individual biomolecules or cells. Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements. Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per A2 with X-rays of 12 keV energy or 1 A wavelength) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

abstract = {A particle beam is produced when a particle-laden gas expands through a nozzle into a vacuum. This work discusses the theoretical basis of a novel method for producing highly collimated and tightly focused particle beams. The approach is to pass the particle-laden gas through a series of axisymmetric contractions and enlargements (so-called aerodynamic lenses) before the nozzle expansion. Particles are moved closer to the axis by a lens if the particle sizes are less than a critical value and particles can be confined very closely to the axis by using multiple lenses in series. Since particles close to the axis experience small radial drag forces, they stay close to the axis during nozzle expansion and therefore form a narrow particle beam downstream. The major effects that limit the minimum beam width are Brownian motion and lift forces on particles during the nozzle expansion. Simple theoretical models are developed in this work to estimate the minimum particle beam width set by these effects. While the...},

Natl Acad. Sci. USA (2005), 102, 15343-15346]. Two refinements of the iterative constraint-based scheme are developed to address the current experimental realities of this imaging technique, which include missing central data and noise. A constrained power operator is defined whose eigenmodes allow the identification of a small number of degrees of freedom in the reconstruction that are negligibly constrained as a result of the missing data. To achieve reproducibility in the algorithm's output, a special intervention is required for these modes. Weak incompatibility of the constraints caused by noise in both direct and Fourier space leads to residual phase fluctuations. This problem is addressed by supplementing the algorithm with an averaging method. The effect of averaging may be interpreted in terms of an effective modulation transfer function, as used in optics, to quantify the resolution. The reconstruction details are prefaced with simulations of wave propagation through a model yeast cell. These show that the yeast cell is a strong-phase-contrast object for the conditions in the experiment.},

abstract = {Flash X-ray imaging has the potential to determine structures down to molecular resolution without the need for crystallization. The ability to accurately predict the diffraction signal and to identify the optimal experimental configuration within the limits of the instrument is important for successful data collection. This article introduces Condor, an open-source simulation tool to predict X-ray far-field scattering amplitudes of isolated particles for customized experimental designs and samples, which the user defines by an atomic or a refractive index model. The software enables researchers to test whether their envisaged imaging experiment is feasible, and to optimize critical parameters for reaching the best possible result. It also aims to support researchers who intend to create or advance reconstruction algorithms by simulating realistic test data. Condor is designed to be easy to use and can be either installed as a Python package or used from its web interface (http://lmb.icm.uu.se/condor). X-ray free-electron lasers have high running costs and beam time at these facilities is precious. Data quality can be substantially improved by using simulations to guide the experimental design and simplify data analysis.},

However, the complexity of imaging a sample's structure from very many of its noisy and incomplete diffraction data can be daunting.

abstract = {We introduce the EMC algorithm for reconstructing a particle's three-dimensional (3D) diffraction intensity from very many photon shot-noise limited two-dimensional measurements, when the particle orientation in each measurement is unknown. The algorithm combines a maximization step (M) of the intensity's likelihood function, with expansion (E) and compression (C) steps that map the 3D intensity model to a redundant tomographic representation and back again. After a few iterations of the EMC update rule, the reconstructed intensity is given to the difference-map algorithm for reconstruction of the particle contrast. We demonstrate reconstructions with simulated data and investigate the effects of particle complexity, number of measurements, and the number of photons per measurement. The relatively transparent scaling behavior of our algorithm provides an estimate of the data processing resources required for future single-particle imaging experiments.},

abstract = {The first hard X-ray laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), produces 120 shots per second. Particles injected into the X-ray beam are hit randomly and in unknown orientations by the extremely intense X-ray pulses, where the femtosecond-duration X-ray pulses diffract from the sample before the particle structure is significantly changed even though the sample is ultimately destroyed by the deposited X-ray energy. Single particle X-ray diffraction experiments generate data at the FEL repetition rate, resulting in more than 400,000 detector readouts in an hour, the data stream during an experiment contains blank frames mixed with hits on single particles, clusters and contaminants. The diffraction signal is generally weak and it is superimposed on a low but continually fluctuating background signal, originating from photon noise in the beam line and electronic noise from the detector. Meanwhile, explosion of the sample creates fragments with a characteristic signature. Here, we describe methods based on rapid image analysis combined with ion Time-of-Flight (ToF) spectroscopy of the fragments to achieve an efficient, automated and unsupervised sorting of diffraction data. The studies described here form a basis for the development of real-time frame rejection methods, e.g. for the European XFEL, which is expected to produce 100 million pulses per hour.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that with a very short and very intense X-ray pulse, the image of a single diffraction pattern may be recorded from a large macromolecule, a virus, or a nanocluster of proteins without the need for a crystal. A three-dimensional data set can be assembled from such images when many copies of the molecule are exposed to the beam one by one in random orientations. We outline a method for structure reconstruction from such a data set in which no independent information is available about the orientation of the images. The basic requirement for reconstruction and/or signal averaging is the ability to tell whether two noisy diffraction patterns represent the same view of the sample or two different views. With this knowledge, averaging techniques can be used to enhance the signal and extend the resolution in a redundant data set. Based on statistical properties of the diffraction pattern, we present an analytical solution to the classification problem. The solution connects the number of incident X-ray photons with the particle size and the achievable resolution. The results are surprising in that they show that classification can be done with less than one photon per pixel in the limiting resolution shell, assuming Poisson-type photon noise in the image. The results can also be used to provide criteria for improvements in other image classification procedures, e.g., those used in electron tomography or diffraction. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have opened up the possibility of structure determination of protein crystals at room temperature, free of radiation damage. The femtosecond-duration pulses of these sources enable diffraction signals to be collected from samples at doses of 1000 MGy or higher. The sample is vaporized by the intense pulse, but not before the scattering that gives rise to the diffraction pattern takes place. Consequently, only a single flash diffraction pattern can be recorded from a crystal, giving rise to the method of serial crystallography where tens of thousands of patterns are collected from individual crystals that flow across the beam and the patterns are indexed and aggregated into a set of structure factors. The high-dose tolerance and the many-crystal averaging approach allow data to be collected from much smaller crystals than have been examined at synchrotron radiation facilities, even from radiation-sensitive samples. Here, we review the interaction of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses with materials and discuss the implications for structure determination. We identify various dose regimes and conclude that the strongest achievable signals for a given sample are attained at the highest possible dose rates, from highest possible pulse intensities.},

Modern techniques for producing extremely bright and coherent X-ray lasers allow a beam of streaming particles to be intercepted and hit by an ultrashort high-energy X-ray beam. Through machine learning methods the data thus collected can be transformed into a three-dimensional volumetric intensity map of the particle itself. The computational complexity associated with this problem is very high such that clusters of data parallel accelerators are required. We have implemented a distributed and highly efficient algorithm for the inversion of large collections of diffraction patterns targeting clusters of hundreds of GPUs. With the expected enormous amount of diffraction data to be produced in the foreseeable future, this is the required scale to approach real-time processing of data at the beam site.

abstract = {A capillary steady microjet produced at the discharge region of a gas jet expanding into vacuum is imaged using scanning electron microscopy. The co-flowing gas focuses by inertia and pulls the liquid fed through a capillary tube concentrically positioned at the discharge orifice. The jet breaks up into well-collimated droplets. Numerical simulation explains the persistence of the liquid phase after discharge into vacuum.},

@article{Ayyer2016a,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-particle imaging (SPI) with X-ray free-electron lasers has the potential to change fundamentally how biomacromolecules are imaged. The structure would be derived from millions of diffraction patterns, each from a different copy of the macromolecule before it is torn apart by radiation damage. The challenges posed by the resultant data stream are staggering: millions of incomplete, noisy and un-oriented patterns have to be computationally assembled into a three-dimensional intensity map and then phase reconstructed. In this paper, the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Dragonfly{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}software package is described, based on a parallel implementation of the expand–maximize–compress reconstruction algorithm that is well suited for this task. Auxiliary modules to simulate SPI data streams are also included to assess the feasibility of proposed SPI experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source, Stanford, California, USA. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Barty2012,
abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have enabled new approaches to the structural determination of protein crystals that are too small or radiation-sensitive for conventional analysis(1). For sufficiently short pulses, diffraction is collected before significant changes occur to the sample, and it has been predicted that pulses as short as 10 fs may be required to acquire atomic-resolution structural information(1-4). Here, we describe a mechanism unique to ultrafast, ultra-intense X-ray experiments that allows structural information to be collected from crystalline samples using high radiation doses without the requirement for the pulse to terminate before the onset of sample damage. Instead, the diffracted X-rays are gated by a rapid loss of crystalline periodicity, producing apparent pulse lengths significantly shorter than the duration of the incident pulse. The shortest apparent pulse lengths occur at the highest resolution, and our measurements indicate that current X-ray free-electron laser technology(5) should enable structural determination from submicrometre protein crystals with atomic resolution.},

@article{Martin2013,
abstract = {The structures of biological molecules may soon be determined with X-ray free-electron lasers without crystallization by recording the coherent diffraction patterns of many identical copies of a molecule. Most analysis methods require a measurement of each molecule individually. However, current injection methods deliver particles to the X-ray beam stochastically and the maximum yield of single particle measurements is 37{\%} at optimal concentration. The remaining 63{\%} of pulses intercept no particles or multiple particles. We demonstrate that in the latter case single particle diffraction patterns can be extracted provided the particles are sufficiently separated. The technique has the potential to greatly increase the amount of data available for three-dimensional imaging of identical particles with X-ray lasers.},

In some circumstances the algorithm may stagnate. New methods are described that allow the algorithm to overcome three different modes of stagnation: those characterized by (1) twin images, (2) stripes, and (3) truncation of the image by the support constraint. Curious properties of Fourier transforms of images are also described: the zero reversal for the striped images and the relationship between the zero lines of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform. A detailed description of the reconstruction method is given to aid those employing the iterative transform algorithm.},
