abstract = {We introduce the EMC algorithm for reconstructing a particle's three-dimensional (3D) diffraction intensity from very many photon shot-noise limited two-dimensional measurements, when the particle orientation in each measurement is unknown. The algorithm combines a maximization step (M) of the intensity's likelihood function, with expansion (E) and compression (C) steps that map the 3D intensity model to a redundant tomographic representation and back again. After a few iterations of the EMC update rule, the reconstructed intensity is given to the difference-map algorithm for reconstruction of the particle contrast. We demonstrate reconstructions with simulated data and investigate the effects of particle complexity, number of measurements, and the number of photons per measurement. The relatively transparent scaling behavior of our algorithm provides an estimate of the data processing resources required for future single-particle imaging experiments.},

abstract = {Ptychography is a coherent diffractive imaging method that uses multiple diffraction patterns obtained through the scan of a localized illumination on the specimen. Until recently, reconstruction algorithms for ptychographic datasets needed the a priori knowledge of the incident illumination. A new reconstruction procedure that retrieves both the specimen's image and the illumination profile was recently demonstrated with hard X-ray data. We present here the algorithm in greater details and illustrate its practical applicability with a visible light dataset. Improvements in the quality of the reconstruction are shown and compared to previous reconstruction techniques. Implications for future applications with other types of radiation are discussed.},

@article{Paganin2004,
abstract = {The science of wave-field phase retrieval and phase measurement is sufficiently mature to permit the routine reconstruction, over a given plane, of the complex wave-function associated with certain coherent forward-propagating scalar wave-fields. This reconstruction gives total knowledge of the information that has been encoded in the complex wave-field by passage through a sample of interest. Such total knowledge is powerful, because it permits the emulation in software of the subsequent action of an infinite variety of coherent imaging systems. Such 'virtual optics', in which software forms a natural extension of the 'hardware optics' in an imaging system, may be useful in contexts such as quantitative atom and X-ray imaging, in which optical elements such as beam-splitters and lenses can be realized in software rather than optical hardware. Here, we develop the requisite theory to describe such hybrid virtual-physical imaging systems, which we term 'omni optics' because of their infinite flexibility. We then give an experimental demonstration of these ideas by showing that a lensless X-ray point projection microscope can, when equipped with the appropriate software, emulate an infinite variety of optical imaging systems including those which yield interferograms, Zernike phase contrast, Schlieren imaging and diffraction-enhanced imaging.},

It is shown that in some cases the phase reconstruction is unique; and that in other cases there is finite or denumerable infinite number of discrete solutions. Conversely, it is proved that every non-negative function that is integrable and band-limited can be realized as the intensity distribution in the image of a star formed by a lens.},

Large scale, quantitative phase information can be measured, unlike in conventional (Zernike) methods. For light optical experiments, we can dispense with expensive high-quality lenses and the very large working distances available would allow remote monitoring of e.g., environmental cells without compromising resolution. In short wavelength microscopy (X-rays and electrons), where lens components are of very limited numerical aperture, the technique has revolutionary implications: objects of any lateral size or shape can be used and, for transmission electron imaging, resolution down to the scale of the wavelength is likely to be limited only by the presence of atomic vibrations.},

abstract = {Sample damage by X-rays and other radiation limits the resolution of structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible structures such as individual biomolecules or cells. Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements. Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per A2 with X-rays of 12 keV energy or 1 A wavelength) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

@article{Liu1995,
abstract = {A particle beam is produced when a particle-laden gas expands through a nozzle into a vacuum. This work discusses the theoretical basis of a novel method for producing highly collimated and tightly focused particle beams. The approach is to pass the particle-laden gas through a series of axisymmetric contractions and enlargements (so-called aerodynamic lenses) before the nozzle expansion. Particles are moved closer to the axis by a lens if the particle sizes are less than a critical value and particles can be confined very closely to the axis by using multiple lenses in series. Since particles close to the axis experience small radial drag forces, they stay close to the axis during nozzle expansion and therefore form a narrow particle beam downstream. The major effects that limit the minimum beam width are Brownian motion and lift forces on particles during the nozzle expansion. Simple theoretical models are developed in this work to estimate the minimum particle beam width set by these effects. While the...},

This virus is widely prevalent and is one of the viruses that cause the most economic damage in many Asian countries. The atomic structure of RDV was determined at 3.5 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The double-shelled structure consists of two different proteins, the core protein P3 and the outer shell protein P8. The atomic structure shows structural and electrostatic complementarities between both homologous (P3-P3 and P8-P8) and heterologous (P3-P8) interactions, as well as overall conformational changes found in P3-P3 dimer caused by the insertion of amino-terminal loop regions of one of the P3 protein into the other. These interactions suggest how the 900 protein components are built into a higher-ordered virus core structure.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton blooms are ephemeral events of exceptionally high primary productivity that regulate the flux of carbon across marine food webs [1-3]. Quantification of bloom turnover [4] is limited by a fundamental difficulty to decouple between physical and biological processes as observed by ocean color satellite data. This limitation hinders the quantification of bloom demise and its regulation by biological processes [5, 6], which has important consequences on the efficiency of the biological pump of carbon to the deep ocean [7-9]. Here, we address this challenge and quantify algal blooms' turnover using a combination of satellite and in situ data, which allows identification of a relatively stable oceanic patch that is subject to little mixing with its surroundings. Using a newly developed multisatellite Lagrangian diagnostic, we decouple the contributions of physical and biological processes, allowing quantification of a complete life cycle of a mesoscale (∼10-100 km) bloom of coccolithophores in the North Atlantic, from exponential growth to its rapid demise. We estimate the amount of organic carbon produced during the bloom to be in the order of 24,000 tons, of which two-thirds were turned over within 1 week. Complimentary in situ measurements of the same patch area revealed high levels of specific viruses infecting coccolithophore cells, therefore pointing at the importance of viral infection as a possible mortality agent. Application of the newly developed satellite-based approaches opens the way for large-scale quantification of the impact of diverse environmental stresses on the fate of phytoplankton blooms and derived carbon in the ocean.},

One of the most challenging problems of SMI is how to assemble these noisy patterns of unknown orientations into a consistent single set of diffraction data. Here we present a new method which can solve the orientation problem of SMI efficiently even for large biological molecules and in the presence of noise. We show on simulated diffraction patterns of a large protein molecule, how the orientations of the patterns can be found and the structure to atomic resolution can be solved. The concept of our algorithm could be also applied to experiments where images of an object are recorded in unknown orientations and/or positions like in cryoEM or tomography. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Some of the properties of " ideal " system which transmii at this maximum rate are disncrsed The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated},

abstract = {The cytomorphological features (cell morphology, type of cell division, cell structure, structure of photosynthetic apparatus) were studied in the type strains of the cyanoprokaryotic genera Cyanobium and Cyanobacterium, and in the reference strain of the traditional genus Synechococcus (Synechococcus PCC 6301; = “Anacystis nidulans” sensu auct.). They were originally described by Rippka {\&} Cohen-Bazire, based on the mean DNA-base composition (moles {\%} G + C) and on the resistance to various cyanophages. The phenotypic diacritical characters were found to coincide well with the molecular markers, and thus, the genera Cyanobium and Cyanobacterium are acceptable also according to the traditional (botanical) taxonomic criteria. The integrated molecular, cytomorphological and ecophysiological approaches to the solution of taxonomic problems in cyanobacteria are therefore inevitable for taxonomic evaluation, from the methodological point of view. The lists of species within the revised genera Cyanobium and Cyanobacterium are reviewed.

These dynamics have important implications for understanding protein function and for structure-based drug design. NMR spectroscopy is particularly well suited to characterize the dynamics of proteins and other molecules in solution at atomic resolution. Here, NMR relaxation methods for characterizing thermal motions on the picosecond-nanosecond (ps-ns) timescale are reviewed. Motion on this timescale can be conveniently captured by the Lipari-Szabo order parameter, S², a bond-specific measure of restriction of motion. Approaches for determining order parameters are discussed, as are recent examples from the literature that link ps-ns dynamics with conformational entropy, allostery, and protein function in general.},

Most of the present knowledge about the fine structure of cyanobacteria is acquired through examination via the transmission electron microscope of thin sections of fixed and resin-embedded specimens. Fixation techniques have improved over the years, and the use of fluid, unpolymerized embedding resins appears to have minimized the production of artifacts. Cryofixation and freeze-etching techniques and the observation of freeze-etched replicas have provided additional information on the internal structure of different types of “unit membranes.” Other techniques such as freeze-drying, metal shadowing, and negative staining have also been used, the former two for examination of details of outer surfaces of cells or organelles, the latter for the observation of subcellular structures such as phycobilisomes, carboxysomes, gas vesicles, fimbriae, or pili. Before fixation, cells actively growing in liquid medium are collected by centrifugation or concentrated on membrane filters. Alternatively, cells can be collected after growth on agar plates.},

abstract = {The emerging technique of serial X-ray diffraction, in which diffraction data are collected from samples flowing across a pulsed X-ray source at repetition rates of 100 Hz or higher, has necessitated the development of new software in order to handle the large data volumes produced. Sorting of data according to different criteria and rapid filtering of events to retain only diffraction patterns of interest results in significant reductions in data volume, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis and management tasks. Meanwhile the generation of reduced data in the form of virtual powder patterns, radial stacks, histograms and other meta data creates data set summaries for analysis and overall experiment evaluation. Rapid data reduction early in the analysis pipeline is proving to be an essential first step in serial imaging experiments, prompting the authors to make the tool described in this article available to the general community. Originally developed for experiments at X-ray free-electron lasers, the software is based on a modular facility-independent library to promote portability between different experiments and is available under version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License.},

@article{Kronig1926,
abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient $\alpha$ and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for $\alpha$. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.1},

However, this rapid development in terms of hardware has not been matched on the software side. The release of Hawk is intended to close this gap. To the authors' knowledge Hawk is the first publicly available and fully open source software program for reconstructing images from continuous diffraction patterns. The software handles all steps leading from a raw diffraction pattern to a reconstructed two-dimensional image including geometry determination, background correction, masking and phasing. It also includes preliminary three-dimensional support and support for graphics processing units using the Compute Unified Device Architecture, which speeds up processing by orders of magnitude compared to a single central processing unit. Hawk implements numerous algorithms and is easily extended. This, in combination with its open-source licence, provides a platform for other groups to test, develop and distribute their own algorithms.

The CA (capsid) and SP1 (spacer peptide 1) region of Gag is the key regulator of assembly and maturation and is the target of MIs. We applied optimized cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to resolve this region within assembled immature HIV-1 particles at 3.9 angstrom resolution and built an atomic model. The structure reveals a network of intra- and intermolecular interactions mediating immature HIV-1 assembly. The proteolytic cleavage site between CA and SP1 is inaccessible to protease. We suggest that MIs prevent CA-SP1 cleavage by stabilizing the structure, and MI resistance develops by destabilizing CA-SP1.},

However, image-restoration problems involving nonconvex constraints cannot be handled by the method of projection onto convex sets in a fashion that ensures convergence. The restoration-from-magnitude (RFM) problem is such a case. To handle the RFM as well as other nonconvex constraints, we describe an algorithm known as generalized projections and discuss its properties. When sets are nonconvex, it is possible for the algorithm to exhibit pathological behavior that is never manifest in convex projections. We introduce an error criterion called the summed-distance error (SDE) and show under what circumstances the SDE is a monotonically decreasing function of the number of iterations. Near-optimum performance of the algorithm is achieved by relaxation parameters. Comparisons with other RFM methods are furnished for synthetic imagery.},

abstract = {Advances in X-ray detectors and increases in the brightness of X-ray sources combined with more efficient sample delivery techniques have brought about tremendous increases in the speed of data collection in diffraction experiments. Using X-ray free-electron lasers such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), more than 100 diffraction patterns can be collected in a second. These high data rates are invaluable for flash X-ray imaging (FXI), where aerosolized samples are exposed to the X-ray beam and the resulting diffraction patterns are used to reconstruct a three-dimensional image of the sample. Such experiments require immediate feedback on the quality of the data collected to adjust or validate experimental parameters, such as aerosol injector settings, beamline geometry or sample composition. The scarcity of available beamtime at the laser facilities makes any delay extremely costly. This paper presents Hummingbird, an open-source scalable Python-based software tool for real-time analysis of diffraction data with the purpose of giving users immediate feedback during their experiments. Hummingbird provides a fast, flexible and easy-to-use framework. It has already proven to be of great value in numerous FXI experiments at the LCLS.},

@article{Howells2009,
abstract = {X-ray diffraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of X-ray imaging that is being practiced at several third-generation synchrotron-radiation X-ray facilities. Nine years have elapsed since the technique was first introduced and it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resolution three-dimensional imaging and promises few-nanometer resolution with much larger samples than can be imaged in the transmission electron microscope. Both life-and materials-science applications of XDM are intended, and it is expected that the principal limitation to resolution will be radiation damage for life science and the coherent power of available X-ray sources for material science. In this paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage. We use a statistical analysis based on the so-called " dose fractionation theorem " of Hegerl and Hoppe to calculate the dose needed to make an image of a single life-science sample by XDM with a given resolution. We find that the needed dose scales with the inverse fourth power of the resolution and present experimental evidence to support this finding. To determine the maximum tolerable dose we have assembled a number of data taken from the literature plus some measurements of our own which cover ranges of resolution that are not well covered otherwise. The conclusion of this study is that, based on the natural contrast between protein and water and " Rose-criterion " image quality, one should be able to image a frozen-hydrated biological sample using XDM at a resolution of about 10 nm.},

abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

abstract = {Photoionization of an atom by X-rays usually removes an inner shell electron from the atom, leaving behind a perturbed "hollow ion" whose relaxation may take different routes. In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is common. However, the energy and the total number of electrons released from the atom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the inner shell electron leaves, the outer shell electrons may find themselves in a state that is not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective excitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low energy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off. It is not clear how significant shake-up and shake-off contributions are to the overall ionization of biological materials like proteins. In particular, the interaction between the outgoing electron and the remaining system depends on the chemical environment of the atom, which can be studied by quantum chemical methods. Here we present calculations on model compounds to represent the most common chemical environments in proteins. The results show that the shake-up and shake-off processes affect approximately 20{\%} of all emissions from nitrogen, 30{\%} from carbon, 40{\%} from oxygen, and 23{\%} from sulfur. Triple and higher ionizations are rare for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, but are frequent for sulfur. The findings are relevant to the design of biological experiments at emerging X-ray free-electron lasers.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules and their complexes are mainly elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major limitation of this method is access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks suggests that crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice give rise to a continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more information than Bragg peaks alone. Although such continuous diffraction patterns have long been observed--and are of interest as a source of information about the dynamics of proteins--they have not been used for structure determination. Here we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the diffraction pattern well beyond the 4.5-{\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m limit of measurable Bragg peaks, which allows us to phase the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope conventionally determined at 4.5 {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}ms as a constraint, we obtain a static image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3.5 {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}ms. This result shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables model-free phasing.},

abstract = {Very short pulses of X-ray free-electron lasers opened the way to obtaining diffraction signal from single particles beyond the radiation dose limit. For three-dimensional structure reconstruction many patterns are recorded in the object's unknown orientation. A method is described for the orientation of continuous diffraction patterns of non-periodic objects, utilizing intensity correlations in the curved intersections of the corresponding Ewald spheres, and hence named the common arc orientation method. The present implementation of the algorithm optionally takes into account Friedel's law, handles missing data and is capable of determining the point group of symmetric objects. Its performance is demonstrated on simulated diffraction data sets and verification of the results indicates a high orientation accuracy even at low signal levels. The common arc method fills a gap in the wide palette of orientation methods.},

abstract = {The availability of a genome-wide set of Saccharomyces deletion mutants provides a chance to identify all the yeast genes involved in DNA repair. Using X rays, we are screening these mutants to identify additional genes that cause increased sensitivity to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation. For each mutant identified as sensitive, we are confirming that the sensitivity phenotype cosegregates with the deletion allele and are obtaining multipoint survival-vs.-dose assays in at least one homozygous diploid and two haploid strains. We present data for deletion mutants involving the genes DOT1, MDM20, NAT3, SPT7, SPT20, GCN5, HFI1, DCC1, and VID21/EAF1 and discuss their potential roles in repair. Eight of these genes cause a clear radiation-sensitive phenotype when deleted, but the ninth, GCN5, results in at most a borderline phenotype. None of the deletions confer substantial sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, although one or two may confer marginal sensitivity. The DOT1 gene is of interest because its only known function is to methylate one lysine residue in the core of the histone H3 protein. We find that histone H3 mutants (supplied by K. Struhl) in which this residue is replaced by other amino acids are also X-ray sensitive, which confirms that methylation of the lysine-79 residue is required for effective repair of radiation damage.},

@article{Cruz-Mazo2017,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper, we analyse numerically the stability of the steady jetting regime of gaseous flow focusing. The base flows are calculated by solving the full Navier–Stokes equations and boundary conditions for a wide range of liquid viscosities and gas speeds. The axisymmetric modes characterizing the asymptotic stability of those flows are obtained from the linearized Navier–Stokes equations and boundary conditions. We determine the flow rates leading to marginally stable states, and compare them with the experimental values at the jetting-to-dripping transition. The theoretical predictions satisfactorily agree with the experimental results for large gas speeds. However, they do not capture the trend of the jetting-to-dripping transition curve for small gas velocities, and considerably underestimate the minimum flow rate in this case. To explain this discrepancy, the Navier–Stokes equations are integrated over time after introducing a small perturbation in the tapering liquid meniscus. There is a transient growth of the perturbation before the asymptotic exponential regime is reached, which leads to dripping. Our work shows that flow focusing stability can be explained in terms of the combination of asymptotic global stability and the system short-term response for large and small gas velocities, respectively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The first hard X-ray laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), produces 120 shots per second. Particles injected into the X-ray beam are hit randomly and in unknown orientations by the extremely intense X-ray pulses, where the femtosecond-duration X-ray pulses diffract from the sample before the particle structure is significantly changed even though the sample is ultimately destroyed by the deposited X-ray energy. Single particle X-ray diffraction experiments generate data at the FEL repetition rate, resulting in more than 400,000 detector readouts in an hour, the data stream during an experiment contains blank frames mixed with hits on single particles, clusters and contaminants. The diffraction signal is generally weak and it is superimposed on a low but continually fluctuating background signal, originating from photon noise in the beam line and electronic noise from the detector. Meanwhile, explosion of the sample creates fragments with a characteristic signature. Here, we describe methods based on rapid image analysis combined with ion Time-of-Flight (ToF) spectroscopy of the fragments to achieve an efficient, automated and unsupervised sorting of diffraction data. The studies described here form a basis for the development of real-time frame rejection methods, e.g. for the European XFEL, which is expected to produce 100 million pulses per hour.},

The ability to accurately predict the diffraction signal and to identify the optimal experimental configuration within the limits of the instrument is important for successful data collection. This article introduces Condor, an open-source simulation tool to predict X-ray far-field scattering amplitudes of isolated particles for customized experimental designs and samples, which the user defines by an atomic or a refractive index model. The software enables researchers to test whether their envisaged imaging experiment is feasible, and to optimize critical parameters for reaching the best possible result. It also aims to support researchers who intend to create or advance reconstruction algorithms by simulating realistic test data. Condor is designed to be easy to use and can be either installed as a Python package or used from its web interface (http://lmb.icm.uu.se/condor). X-ray free-electron lasers have high running costs and beam time at these facilities is precious. Data quality can be substantially improved by using simulations to guide the experimental design and simplify data analysis.},
